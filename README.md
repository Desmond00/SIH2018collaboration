# SIH2018collaboration

This project is a part of [Smart India Hackathon 2018](https://innovate.mygov.in/sih2018/). The project deals with a smart system which 
can predict admission percentage of an engineering college based on its demographic information. This will help AICTE (All India 
Council for Technical Education) to carefully approve its grants.
